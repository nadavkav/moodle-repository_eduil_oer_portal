moodle-repository_eduil_oer_portal
==================================

Moodle repository plugin for the Israeli Ministry of education OER portal (Database)
Link: http://gadol.edu.gov.il/

It Uses the HTML parsing library: PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser 
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/simplehtmldom/)

Any change in the portal html dom structure could break the search
Hopefully, in the near future EDUIL will switch the some standard RESTful API
that we can query the OER DB safely :-)
